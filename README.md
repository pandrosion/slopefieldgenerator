# slopefieldgenerator

This program will obtain an ordinary differential equation of order 2 or lower with the option of adding initial conditions and do the following:

- Display the slope field, with the solution highlighted if initial conditions are given.
- Identify any equilibrium, sink, saddle, or source points
- If applicable, identify a characteristic equation and characteristic roots
- If applicable, generate a general solution based on characterisic roots and, for non-homogenous ODEs, generate a particular solution using variation of parameters.

In the future, potential updates could include:

- Identify points as spiral or degenerate
- Display recommendation for method(s) to solve a given ODE
- Solve given ODEs with recommended methods and display the process of doing so
- Obtain potential solutions and (1) verify whether or not they are solutions, and (2) determine if they form a fundamental set of solutions
